Aufgabe 3.2
	Test output of equals() on positions of a 20x20 board: 2/2
	Test output of hashCode() on positions of a 20x20 board: 8/8
Total points for Aufgabe 3.2: 10/10

Aufgabe 3.3
	Test output of equals(): 4/4
	Test whether equals() was implemented based on hashCode(), which it shouldn't: 1/1
	Test consistency of hashCode() with a correct equals() method: 5/5
	Test distribution of hashCode() values (on asmall data set): 5/5
	Test distribution of hashCode() values (and timeout may indicate insufficient running time): 5/5
Total points for Aufgabe 3.3: 20/20

Aufgabe 3.4
	Test output of testBfsWithHashing() for tiny boards: 0/5
	  java.lang.AssertionError: Method 'bfsWithHashing()' does not return the expected result.
We called bfsWithHashing() for board 'tests/samples/rrBoard-T-3x3-00.txt' which can be downloaded from https://tubcloud.tu-berlin.de/s/8B5tDQJ6e2swtkP.
The shortest solution has 4 moves, while your returned a move sequence containing 1 moves.Note, that a timeout may indicate that the method is not efficient (e.g. if hashing is not working properly).
	Test output of testBfsWithHashing() for boards of type XS: 0/10
	  java.lang.AssertionError: Method 'bfsWithHashing()' does not return the expected result.
We called bfsWithHashing() for board 'tests/samples/rrBoard-XS-4x4-00.txt' which can be downloaded from https://tubcloud.tu-berlin.de/s/8B5tDQJ6e2swtkP.
The shortest solution has 8 moves, while your returned a move sequence containing 1 moves.Note, that a timeout may indicate that the method is not efficient (e.g. if hashing is not working properly).
	Test output of testBfsWithHashing() for boards of type S: 0/15
	  java.lang.AssertionError: Method 'bfsWithHashing()' does not return the expected result.
We called bfsWithHashing() for board 'tests/samples/rrBoard-S-5x5-00.txt' which can be downloaded from https://tubcloud.tu-berlin.de/s/8B5tDQJ6e2swtkP.
The shortest solution has 8 moves, while your returned a move sequence containing 1 moves.Note, that a timeout may indicate that the method is not efficient (e.g. if hashing is not working properly).
	Test output of testBfsWithHashing() for boards of type M: 0/20
	  java.lang.AssertionError: Method 'bfsWithHashing()' does not return the expected result.
We called bfsWithHashing() for board 'tests/samples/rrBoard-D-4x4-00.txt' which can be downloaded from https://tubcloud.tu-berlin.de/s/8B5tDQJ6e2swtkP.
The shortest solution has 18 moves, while your returned a move sequence containing 1 moves.Note, that a timeout may indicate that the method is not efficient (e.g. if hashing is not working properly).
	Test output of testBfsWithHashing() for boards of type L: 0/20
	  java.lang.AssertionError: Method 'bfsWithHashing()' does not return the expected result.
We called bfsWithHashing() for board 'tests/samples/rrBoard-C3-6x4-00.txt' which can be downloaded from https://tubcloud.tu-berlin.de/s/8B5tDQJ6e2swtkP.
The shortest solution has 34 moves, while your returned a move sequence containing 1 moves.Note, that a timeout may indicate that the method is not efficient (e.g. if hashing is not working properly).
Total points for Aufgabe 3.4: 0/70
